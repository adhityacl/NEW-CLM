# Tenant boundaries and unified Settings — handoff

Implementation of `docs/rbac/TENANT-BOUNDARIES-SETTINGS-PRD.md` on branch `tenant-boundaries-wip`.
Companion documents: `tenant-boundaries-endpoint-inventory.md` (generated route/policy inventory) and the PRD itself.

## 1. How to verify

| Command | What it runs | Environment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `npm test` | Unit suites `tests/*.test.ts` (RBAC policy, i18n parity, demo dataset, business helpers) | in-process, no server, no database |
| `npm run test:tenant-boundaries` | `tests/tenant-boundaries/{api,migration,store}.test.ts` + `tests/rbac.test.ts` | each live server is the bundled `server.ts` started from its own `mkdtemp` directory with `APP_TEST_MODE=1`, `AUTH_DB_PATH`/`APP_DATA_DIR` inside it, no Google/SMTP/AI transport; the runner checksums the workspace `auth.db*`, `uploads/` and `data_store.json` before/after and fails if they change (AC-040) |
| `npm run test:e2e:fixtures` | `playwright.fixtures.config.ts`: mocked-API browser specs against `vite preview` | every `/api/**` request is intercepted (`tests/e2e/fixtures/tenantApi.ts`); no server, no database |
| `npm run test:e2e:tenant-boundaries` | `playwright.tenant-boundaries.config.ts`: live browser specs | `tests/e2e/isolated/globalSetup.ts` starts the bundled server (`APP_TEST_MODE=1`) in a temporary directory, seeds the synthetic §16.1 `example.test` matrix, serves the built frontend with `vite preview` proxied to it, and deletes everything at teardown; same workspace checksum guard as above |
| `npm run test:e2e` | same isolated live suite (the default config re-exports the tenant-boundaries config) | never opens the workspace `auth.db`; `tests/e2e/seed.ts` refuses to run without the isolated environment |
| `npx tsx tools/gen-endpoint-inventory.ts [--check]` | regenerates / checks the endpoint inventory | reads source and `node_modules` only |

Live browser ports: preview `127.0.0.1:4290`, API `4291` (override with `TB_E2E_WEB_PORT` / `TB_E2E_API_PORT`; `TB_E2E_SKIP_BUILD=1` reuses an existing `dist/`).

## 2. Validation results for this handoff

Run on 2026-10-05 in a Linux dev container (Node ≥ 20, Chromium from Playwright), sequentially, on the commit before this document:

| Command | Result | Excerpt |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `npm test` | passed | `# tests 97 # pass 97 # fail 0` |
| `npm run test:tenant-boundaries` | passed | `# tests 68 # pass 68 # fail 0` — `[tenant-boundaries] Workspace runtime files unchanged (auth.db, uploads/, data_store.json).` |
| `npm run lint` (type-check, full `tsc --noEmit`) | passed | exit 0, no diagnostics |
| `npm run test:e2e:fixtures` | **failed (5 pre-existing)** | `5 failed, 75 passed (6.1m)` — the five failures are the baseline failures listed in section 3; every new and updated tenant-boundaries test passed |
| `npm run test:e2e:tenant-boundaries` | passed | `31 passed (1.6m)` — `[tenant-boundaries] Workspace runtime files unchanged …` |
| `npm run build` | passed | `✓ built in 19.41s`, backend bundle written, exit 0 |

## 3. Acceptance evidence (PRD §16.2)

Test names are quoted from the files: `api` = `tests/tenant-boundaries/api.test.ts`, `migration`/`store` = same folder, `rbac` = `tests/rbac.test.ts`,
`live` = `tests/e2e/tenant-boundaries.live.spec.ts`, `nav`/`routing` = `tests/e2e/admin-nav-rbac.spec.ts` / `spa-query-routing.spec.ts` (live),
`settings` = `tests/e2e/settings-tenant-boundaries.spec.ts`, `refinements`/`a11y` = `ui-refinements` / `ui-accessibility` specs (mocked).
Environments: **I-API** isolated live server (`test:tenant-boundaries`), **I-BR** isolated live browser (`test:e2e:tenant-boundaries`), **M-BR** mocked browser (`test:e2e:fixtures`), **U** unit (`npm test` / rbac).
"Result" is the outcome of the runs in section 2.

### Pre-existing fixture failures (not caused by this change)

Five mocked browser tests fail identically on the parent commit `5d17ce2` (before any tenant-boundaries work) when run with that commit's own specs and mocks (61 passed / 5 failed). They assert content that changed in earlier, unrelated commits — the demo dataset no longer contains "PT Mitra Nusantara" (`92b219e`), the header language control is a button + dialog rather than a `<select>` / `.app-header-languages` group, and the spending edit form's legacy month hydration. They were left unchanged (PRD §16.3: record unchanged baseline failures, do not expand into unrelated repair):

- `ui-refinements` › "requiring action table combines contracts and order forms"
- `ui-refinements` › "header controls align, desktop checkboxes stay 14px and dropdowns share Contracts styling"
- `ui-refinements` › "Contracts mobile layout is justified without a visible breadcrumb, scroll hint or frozen identity"
- `ui-refinements` › "Parties panel selects a registered partner and edits both agreement parties"
- `spending-form` › "Edit hydrates legacy months and preserves both attachments"

## 4. Migration operator instructions (PRD §14)

Run this **before** starting the new version against an existing database. The new server refuses to serve (`503 MIGRATION_REQUIRED` on every API route except `/api/health` and `/api/system/public-status`) while legacy data exists without the `002_tenant_boundaries` ledger entry. A fresh, empty database initializes the new schema directly.

1. **Stop the application** (or take it out of service) so the source is not written during the migration.
2. **Dry-run** (default; opens the database read-only, imports no auth/startup code):
   ```bash
   npm run tenant-boundaries:migrate -- --db /srv/clm/auth.db --report /srv/clm/migration/report.json
   ```
   All paths must be absolute. Accepted flags: `--db`, `--report`, `--mapping`, `--dry-run`, `--apply`, `--backup`; anything else is rejected.
   The JSON report (`formatVersion: 1`, `migrationId`, `sourceDigest`, `conflicts`, `plannedChanges`, `applied: false`) contains counts, canonical organization mappings and redacted record references — no emails, secrets or tokens (secret presence is reported as booleans).
3. **Review conflicts.** Each conflict has a stable `conflictId`, a `kind` (for example `ambiguous-platform-role`, `missing-membership`, `orphan-membership`, `orphan-team-assignment`, `unknown-department-reference`, `settings-source-disagreement`, `shared-resource-mapping`, `global-notification-recipients`, `unowned-resource`) and the resolution kinds it permits. Nothing is guessed: a bare global `owner`, unknown roles, conflicting duplicate memberships, orphans and records without a verifiable organization block apply until resolved.
4. **Write a mapping file** for the blocking conflicts (only the decisions the report allows for each conflict):
   ```json
   {
     "formatVersion": 1,
     "migrationId": "002_tenant_boundaries",
     "sourceDigest": "<sourceDigest from the dry-run report>",
     "resolutions": [
       { "conflictId": "c-…", "decision": "set-platform-role", "userId": "<id>", "platformRole": "user" },
       { "conflictId": "c-…", "decision": "set-membership", "userId": "<id>", "organizationId": "<org>", "tenantRole": "manager", "status": "active", "departmentIds": ["<team>"], "survivingMembershipId": "<member id or null>" },
       { "conflictId": "c-…", "decision": "map-organization", "organizationId": "<existing org>" },
       { "conflictId": "c-…", "decision": "set-settings-field", "organizationId": "<org>", "fieldPath": "notifications.legalNotificationEmail", "value": "legal@example.com" },
       { "conflictId": "c-…", "decision": "quarantine-resource" }
     ]
   }
   ```
   Unknown fields, unknown/duplicate conflict IDs, mismatched identities/organizations, foreign departments and unsupported decisions are rejected. Re-run the dry-run with `--mapping` until the report shows no blocking conflicts.
5. **Apply with a backup** (the backup path must not exist; it is written with SQLite's online backup API, so WAL content is included, before the single write transaction starts):
   ```bash
   npm run tenant-boundaries:migrate -- --db /srv/clm/auth.db --report /srv/clm/migration/apply-report.json \
     --mapping /srv/clm/migration/mapping.json --apply --backup /srv/clm/migration/before-002.db
   ```
   Apply re-checks `sourceDigest` inside the transaction; if the database changed since the dry-run, nothing is written — dry-run again. On success the ledger entry is recorded and **all sessions are invalidated once** (users sign in again; credentials are untouched). Re-running apply makes no further semantic change.
6. **Start the new version.**

**Restore / rollback.** A failed apply rolls back and leaves no ledger entry. To undo a successful apply, stop the application, keep the migrated file aside, and restore the backup as the database together with the *previous* application build (offline, operator-controlled):
```bash
cp /srv/clm/auth.db /srv/clm/migration/after-002.db      # keep for analysis
cp /srv/clm/migration/before-002.db /srv/clm/auth.db
rm -f /srv/clm/auth.db-wal /srv/clm/auth.db-shm
```
Never start the old authorization code against a partially or fully migrated database, and never start the new code against the restored legacy file without migrating again.

## 5. Changed compatibility payloads

| Endpoint | Before | Now |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /api/user/my-role` | one global `role` string, department label; could create an allowlist row | identity DTO of `/api/me` plus `email`, `name`, `platformRole`, `loginTime`; side-effect free; `?probe=1` returns 204 when signed out |
| `GET /api/rbac/me` | `{ actor: { role, tenantId }, permissions }` incl. `['*']` bootstrap | `{ ok, identity: { id, platformRole }, platformPermissions, context: <capability DTO> \| null, permissions }`; explicit lists, never a wildcard; empty when no organization context |
| `GET /api/tenants` | all tenants for admins, could update the global active tenant / provision on GET | `{ success, tenants (accessible projections only), organizations: [{ organizationId, organizationName, slug, logoUrl, tenantRole, accessMode }], activeTenantId: <this session's validated default or null> }`; no side effects |
| `POST /api/tenants/switch` | wrote a global active tenant | adapter to `POST /api/me/active-organization`: session default only, membership validated |
| `GET /api/init-data` | all operational arrays + `tenants` + redacted `googleConfig` | `WorkspaceInitResponse`: `organizationId`, the six scoped arrays, `services: { aiAvailable, googleUploadsAvailable }`, `timestamp`; no tenants, no provider configuration |
| `GET /api/departments` | name strings, could fall back to the first organization | `{ success, departments: <names>, items: [{ id, name }] }` for the selected organization only (managers/editors/viewers: assigned departments) |
| `GET /api/tenant-settings` | mixed policy + legacy fields | runtime policy view of the explicitly selected organization (same shape as `GET /api/organizations/:id/policy`) |
| `PUT /api/tenant-settings` | spread arbitrary body into settings | strict adapter to the settings service: only `settings`, `legalEntity`, `expectedVersion` (optional; defaults to the current version), `organizationId`; any other field (provider, SMTP, …) is `400 INVALID_INPUT`; response adds `success: true` to the policy view |
| `GET /api/branding` | full branding object | presentation fields only (`appName`, `logoUrl`, `primaryColor`, `footerText`, `loginHeadline`); `POST` is platform-only |
| `GET /api/activity-logs` | could include unowned events | scoped operational log of the selected organization, `tenant.audit.read` only |
| `POST /api/google-integration/sync`, `sync-flush`, `/api/tenants/:id/sync-google` | fake success / timestamps | `409 SYNC_UNAVAILABLE` after the authorization check; `GET …/sync-status` returns `{ organizationId, active: false, queueLength: 0, status: 'unavailable', syncSupported: false }` |
| `/api/auth-console/*` account, session, API-key, SQLite, overview, bulk families | reachable by tenant admins with organization filters | platform-only (`platform.*` permissions); tenant callers use `/api/organizations/:id/*` |
| Errors | free-form `{ error }` | `{ error: <CODE>, message, requestId }` with the §5.6 status codes |

## 6. Removed tenant global-account actions

Tenant administrators (and the Members & Access tab) no longer have: create account (replaced by **Invite member**), ban/unban account, delete account, set or reset another user's password, change another user's email, change platform role, list or revoke other users' sessions, or any Better Auth Admin/Organization plugin endpoint. Tenant actions are **Suspend membership**, **Reactivate membership**, **Remove membership**, role and department changes within the §4.3 hierarchy, invitations, and departments. Global account lifecycle stays in System Admin (superuser only). The Organization Admin sidebar parent, the six-section Settings page and the standalone Activity Logs page are gone (Activity is the History drawer in Members & Access; platform cards are System Admin › Configuration).

## 7. Known limitations

- The document drafting workspace (`contract_documents`, My Documents) is **organization-scoped, not department-scoped**: any member with `document.view` in the organization sees its drafts.
- **Department rename is blocked** (`409 DEPARTMENT_IN_USE`) while records reference the department by name, because legacy partner/contract ownership is resolved by exact normalized department name. Delete is blocked the same way.
- **Better Auth `change-password` needs the signed session cookie**, so Google-only sessions have no password flow; Account Security shows the sign-in method and the user's own sessions instead.
- No password-reset-by-email flow is exposed (`/api/auth/request-password-reset` is outside the allowlist); platform administrators reset passwords in System Admin.
- Google synchronization remains a placeholder (`syncSupported: false`); SQLite is authoritative.
- AC-029 (AI/OCR/export/reminder scoping) and parts of AC-006/007/026/027/034 have only partial evidence — see section 3.
- Five pre-existing mocked UI tests fail independently of this change — see section 3.
- PRD §17.1 UI screenshots (admin, manager, viewer, superuser contexts) are not delivered with this handoff; Playwright traces/screenshots are only kept in `test-results/` for failing or explicitly captured steps.
- The live browser suite uses fixed ports 4290/4291 and builds the frontend in global setup (about a minute).
